## App Description:

This application functions as a mental health chatbot. Users can interact with the chatbot through voice input, with their speech transcribed into text and processed by the Gemini API. The chatbot generates text-based responses and provides audio feedback using text-to-speech.

## Gemini API Integration:

The Gemini API is utilized to generate human-like text responses to user queries. The transcribed user speech is sent as a prompt to the Gemini API. The API's response is then processed to generate audio output, providing a more interactive and engaging user experience.
